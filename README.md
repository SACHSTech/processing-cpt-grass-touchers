# PAC-MAN

This program is a two-player version of the classic arcade game, Pac-Man. In Pac-Man, you play as a yellow circle who is trying to eat pellets on q map. However, there are four ghosts who will try to stop you from doing this. Touching a ghost means you will lose a life. If you lose all three of your lives, it's game over. 

To get rid of the ghosts, there are power pellets located in the corners of the map. Eating a power pellet allows Pac-Man to eat the ghosts as well, earning him more points and making it easier to traverse the map. You will know if you can eat a ghost if it turns dark blue. Ghosts that are eaten will run back to their spawn point and cannot be eaten again until Pac-Man eats another power pellet. 

There are also bonus fruits which spawn in the middle of the map at random times. Eating these fruits earns you extra points, and they will appear in a set order as you progress further through the game and each level. The goal of this game is to eat every single pellet on the map. Doing this will take you to the next level of the game. You earn points for every pellet or fruit that you eat. Since this is a two player version of the game, both players will have thier points scored separately from each other.
