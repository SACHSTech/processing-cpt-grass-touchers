# PAC-MAN

This program is a two-player version of the classic arcade game, Pac-Man where one player is Pac-Man and the other is the ghost. In Pac-Man, you play as a yellow circle who is trying to eat pellets on q map. However, there is a ghost who will try to stop you from doing this. Touching the ghost means you will lose a life. If you lose all three of your lives, it's game over. 

To get rid of the ghost, there are power pellets located in the corners of the map. Eating a power pellet allows Pac-Man to eat the ghost as well, earning him more points and making it easier to traverse the map. You will know if you can eat a ghost if it turns dark blue. Ghosts that are eaten will run back to their spawn point and cannot be eaten again until Pac-Man eats another power pellet. 

There are also bonus fruits which spawn in the middle of the map at random times. Eating these fruits earns you extra points, and they will appear in a set order as you progress further through the game and each level. Pac-Man wins by eating all of the pellets, the ghost wins if he takes all three of Pac-Man's lives. Pac-Man earns points for every pellet or fruit that he eats.
